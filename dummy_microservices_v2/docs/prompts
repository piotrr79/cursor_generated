PROMPT: In dummy_microservices_v2 folder generate an app which displays current possiotion of International Space Station. This must be microservice apllication with backend api, frontend ui and custom authorisation provider. Microservices must communicate each other wiith RestApi. 
Backend api must be generated with FastApi, authorisation provider must be generated with Django framework, frontend app must be generated with React. All generated code must follow OOP and SOLID standards. Unit tests must be generated. Docker files with ngingx vhosts must gen created for every application.

PROMPT: Proceed
RESPONSE:
- Added unit tests for ISSService (Jest, fetch mocked).

PROMPT: Proceed
RESPONSE:
- Added unit tests for AuthService (Jest, fetch and localStorage mocked).

PROMPT: Proceed
RESPONSE:

RESPONSE:
- Added unit tests for Login and ISSPosition components (React Testing Library, AuthService/ISSService mocked).
- Improved frontend styling in App.css for layout, forms, navigation, and messages.
