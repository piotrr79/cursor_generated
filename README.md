# ISS Tracker Multi-Stack DemoProject Overview

This is a test of code generation with Cursor. This repository contains several example applications in different languages and frameworks, each demonstrating ISS (International Space Station) position tracking or related logic.

The project showcases different technology stacks and architectural patterns, including:

- Microservices (React, FastAPI, Django, OAuth, PHP, Java, Symfony, Apex, ML)
- OOP and SOLID principles
- REST APIs, JWT authentication, and containerization (Docker, Nginx)
- Unit testing and modular code organization

Each subfolder contains a self-contained implementation or service, with its own README and setup instructions.

## Approach
As a first `dummy_fast_api` was generated and improved with several extra prompts. When code quality was good enough to meet standards Cursor was asked to convert it to different languages, Salesforce Apex in `dummy_apex`, PHP in `dummy_php`, PHP with Symfony framework in  `dummy_symfony` and Java in `dummy_java`. Conversion was done each time from initial Python code.

In another two tests Cursor was prompted to generate the same apllication from the beginning, but this time in microservices architecture, with requirements defined in /docs folder. 

There supposed to be three microservices, forntend in React, backend in Python FastApi and Authorisation app in Python Django. Project folder are `dummy_microservices` and `dummy_microservices_v2`

First test `dummy_microservices` failed. Scond test `dummy_microservices_v2` with improved guidance and more detailed prompts passed. Prompts logs can be checked in `dummy_microservices/docs/prompts` and `dummy_microservices_v2/docs/prompts`

## Contents

This repository contains multiple dummy projects, each demonstrating a different technology stack or microservice pattern. For details, see the README in each project folder:

- **dummy_microservices_v2**: Modern microservices ISS tracker (React, FastAPI, Django). [See README](dummy_microservices_v2/README.md)
- **dummy_microservices**: Microservices ISS tracker (React, FastAPI, Python OAuth). [See README](dummy_microservices/README.md)
- **dummy_symfony**: ISS tracker in Symfony/PHP. [See README](dummy_symfony/README.md)
- **dummy_fast_api**: ISS tracker in FastAPI/Python. [See README](dummy_fast_api/README.md)
- **dummy_ml**: Simple ML API demo. [See README](dummy_ml/Readme.md)
- **dummy_apex**: ISS logic in Salesforce Apex. [See README](dummy_apex/Readme.md)
- **dummy_php**: ISS tracker in PHP. [See README](dummy_php/Readme.md)
- **dummy_java**: ISS tracker in Java/Spring. [See README](dummy_java/Readme.md)

For architecture, prompts, and technical details, see the `dummy_microservices_v2/docs/` and `dummy_microservices/docs/` folders.

# Conclusions:
- **While Cursor is very good in generating smaller chunks of code it not so efficient in complex apllication generation (like `dummy_microservices`, `dummy_microservices_v2`).**
- **Code must be generated by qualified developer to meet standars.**
- **In case of smaller application (e.g. `dummy_fast_api`) it still requires several prompts to refactor code to meet OOP and SOLID.**
- **By default gerated code is procedural, unless OOP / SOLID are sctrictly specified in prompt.**

# Complex code generation issues based on `dummy_microservices`:
- **OOP / SOLID** - Cursor ignored guaidance defined in rules and generated flat code, not encapsulated in classes. Wen asked for refactoring created nested classes in one file and ignored some other files from refactoring. When asked for spliting files did not executed prompt correctly, refactored files were not removed. Overall generated code was to messy.
- **Type hints** - Missing type hints in Python code, even thus it was defined as requirement in /docs
- **Docs** - Missing Docs in Python code, even thus it was defined as requirement in /docs
- **Ignored files** - For fronted attached template file was ingored, React app was created without css styles and core html. Attached template was considered as final React template (not example) and was not attached to fronted app. Public folder is missing.
