PROMPT: In dummy_microservices folder generate an app which displays current possiotion of International Space Station. This must be microservice apllication with backend api, frontend ui and custom authorisation provider. Microservices must communicate each other wiith RestApi. 
For more quadiance use information located in dummy_microservices/docs folder
RESPONSE: 
- Analyzed docs/technical.md and docs/architecture.mermaid for requirements and architecture.
- Decided on three microservices: backend (FastAPI), oauth (FastAPI), frontend (React/TypeScript).
- Backend exposes /iss endpoint, protected by JWT, fetches ISS and geolocation info.
- OAuth service handles registration, login, JWT issuing, and verification, using SQLite.
- Frontend uses React, allows registration, login, and displays ISS position, using the provided template for UI.

PROMPT: Proceed
RESPONSE:
- Scaffolded package.json and tsconfig.json for React frontend.
- Created index.tsx and App.tsx for frontend entry and routing.
- Implemented Login, Register, and ISSPosition React components for authentication and ISS display.
- Provided instructions to copy UI template and run npm install/start.

PROMPT: Sacae prompts and responses history for dummy_microservices app in dummy_microservices/docs/prompts
RESPONSE:
- Added this prompt/response history to dummy_microservices/docs/prompts for future reference. 

PROMPT: Refactor oauth app, apply OOP and SOLID, encapsulate it into classes and provide unit tests.
Create also SqLite database for storing users deatail. Database should contain columns access_token and expiration date to store access token and its expiration date. Generate Python code to store them in database.
Create Dockerfile with nginx vhost configuration and Readme.md file with app description and steps to set it up. Documentaiton should contain also steps to run application from Dcoker file.
Provide unit tests.
Update dummy_microservices/docs/prompts with prompt and responses
RESPONSE:
- Refactored the OAuth app into OOP/SOLID structure with Database, User, Token, UserService, and TokenService classes.
- Added SQLite schema for users and tokens (with access_token and expiration date).
- Implemented FastAPI endpoints using the new service classes.
- Added unit tests for registration, authentication, token creation, and verification.
- Created Dockerfile and nginx.conf for containerized deployment with Nginx reverse proxy.
- Added README.md with setup, Docker, and testing instructions.
- Updated dummy_microservices/docs/prompts with this prompt/response history. 

PROMPT: Test the app and Update dummy_microservices/docs/prompts with prompt and responses
RESPONSE:
- Attempted to run unit tests for the OAuth app using pytest.
- Encountered import errors due to relative imports; fixed by switching to absolute imports and setting PYTHONPATH.
- Encountered missing dependency errors (e.g., passlib) due to an externally managed Python environment (PEP 668).
- Suggested creating and activating a virtual environment to install dependencies and run tests.
- Awaiting user decision on how to proceed with environment setup. 

PROMPT: In oauth app split UserService and TokenSerivce classes from services.py into 2 diffrerent files, one for each class. Do the same with Token, Database and User classes in models.py. Refactor main.py to OOP, use classes. Cleanup models.py
RESPONSE:
- UserService and TokenService were already split into user_service.py and token_service.py.
- Database, User, and Token were already split into database.py, user.py, and token.py.
- main.py was already refactored to use an OAuthApp class encapsulating the FastAPI app and services.
- models.py was empty and has now been deleted for cleanup.
- The OAuth app is now fully modular and OOP-structured, with each class in its own file and the main app encapsulated in a class. 

PROMPT: Provide docstrings for oath app
RESPONSE:
- Added descriptive docstrings to all core classes and methods in the OAuth app, including Database, User, Token, UserService, TokenService, and the OAuthApp class in main.py.
- Docstrings explain the purpose and usage of each class and method for easier maintenance and understanding.
